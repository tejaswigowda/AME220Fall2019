## Task

Starting with ``handout/`` (identical to solution of A4 sans jquery inclusion), the slide show functionality

That is:
1. Clicking on any slide number should take user to slide (5 pts)
2. Next/Prev buttons should work
3. 2 pts extra credit if you can animate the fadeIn/fadeOut. (Hint: use css transitions(https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp))
